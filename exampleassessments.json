Think of it like a digital filing cabinet where data is arranged so it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases use special structures called tables that organize information into rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. For example, a school database might have tables for students, teachers, and classes, with each student record containing fields for name, grade, and contact information. Databases are important because they allow us to store large amounts of information efficiently, find specific data quickly using searches and filters, maintain accuracy by updating information in one place, and share data securely among multiple users. We interact with databases daily when we use apps to check social media, shop online, or play games that save our progress.","isCorrect":true,"subRating":{"rating":9,"rubrics":[{"levels":[{"name":"Excellent","quote":"A database is an organized collection of information stored electronically.
